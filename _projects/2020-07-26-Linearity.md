We can use residual plots to determine if there is a non-linear relationship.  I am going to demonstrate this using the Auto dataset. 

First load in the dataset


```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```


```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sik-flow/datasets/master/auto-mpg.csv')
```


```python
# remove missing values in horsepower
df = df[df['horsepower'] != '?']
df['horsepower'] = df['horsepower'].astype(float)
```


```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
```

Now I am going to fit a model with all of the below features


```python
model = 'mpg ~ cylinders + \
                 displacement + \
                 horsepower + \
                 weight + \
                 acceleration + \
                 origin'

model = smf.ols(formula=model, data=df)
model_fit = model.fit()
model_fitted_y = model_fit.fittedvalues
```


```python
sns.residplot(model_fitted_y, 'mpg', data=df, 
                          lowess=True, 
                          scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5}, 
                          line_kws={'color': 'red', 'lw': 1, 'alpha': 0.8})
plt.xlabel('Fitted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals');
```

The red line is fitted to the points.  I am looking for this line to be roughly straight along the 0 line of the residuals.  We see that this line is close to be straight.  We can verify the residuals using a density plot. 


```python
sns.distplot(model_fit.resid)
```

Residuals appear to be normal.  

Lets see what it looks like when we have a non-linear relationship between the independent and dependent variable. 


```python
model = 'mpg ~ horsepower'

model = smf.ols(formula=model, data=df)
model_fit = model.fit()
model_fitted_y = model_fit.fittedvalues
```


```python
sns.residplot(model_fitted_y, 'mpg', data=df, 
                          lowess=True, 
                          scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5}, 
                          line_kws={'color': 'red', 'lw': 1, 'alpha': 0.8})
plt.xlabel('Fitted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals');
```

Now we see the red line makes a `U` pattern - this indicates there is a non-linear relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable.  To combat this I would recommend trying to transform the independent with `log(X)`, `sqrt(X)`, or `X^2`.

Jeff Herman is a data scientist instructor at a online bootcamp. Jeff previously was a data scientist in the transportation industry and has taught data science at 3 previous data science bootcamps. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Missouri and is pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics from Georgia Tech. His interest in data analytics began after completing a series of MOOCs on the subject.

Jeff is a lifetime player and fan of hockey, having started playing roller hockey at age 6 and transitioning to ice hockey later on. In his free time, Jeff loves reasearching simulation and optimization techniques, exploring new ways to interpret machine learning models, watching NHL and NBA games, and eating french toast.

The goal of this website is for Jeff to explore his interests in data science. He is particularly interested in applying machine learning to sports, especially hockey. By sharing his work, he hopes others will be able to learn from it and that he, in turn, can learn from experience and feedback.

Jeff is currently accepting new projects. Please reach out if you have a need for a passionate data scientist to make sense of your data (special consideration for sports-related data, nonprofits, and data related to social causes).
